### Abstract

In this assignment, you will be implementing client-side sharding for the expense management application that you built in the assignment 1.

### Prerequistes

* Completed the assignment 1.

### Requirements

* Modify existing POST /v1/expenses endpoint so that it can take "id" as input instead of server generated id.
* Three Docker the expense management applicaiton instances - each application instance uses its own MySQL instance.
* Three Docker MySQL DB instances mounted to two different local paths so that each one will have different data set.

#### Consistent Hashing

* Using [this example as baseline](http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2012/07/07/the-absolutely-simplest-consistent-hashing-example/), implement Consistent hashing HTTP client that will POST new expenses (to /v1/expenses) to the above three instances. 
* You don't need to support replicas feature from the above example.
* Use __id__ as the shard key.
* Correct consistent hashing client should shard the following ten expenses into multiple back-end instances.
